# eray

`eray` is a cross-platform rendering library written in C++23, which consists of the following modules:
- `os`: provides operating system abstraction, allows for window creation and it's management (currently, only GLFW is supported), provides a compile-time window event system,  
- `math`: vectors, matrices, quaternions and more, greatly influenced by [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm),
- `util`: utilities used among the codebase, e.g. logger, enum mapper, 
- `driver`: ships rendering API objects for OpenGL and in the future Direct3D11,
- `res`: resource system based on handles.

The main goal of the library is to serve me as a framework for building computer graphics applications while also providing me an opportunity to learn about engine programming.
